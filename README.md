# TTT-with-numbers
Tic tac toe with numbers is a simple game that works like tic tac toe but with numbers, whoever gets the sum of their numbers to 15 first wins. The first player can use odd numbers from 1 to 9 and the second player can use even numbers from 0 to 8. If both players ran out of numbers to use and no one has won then it's a draw.
